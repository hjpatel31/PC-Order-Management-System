# PC-Order-Management-System
This C++ project manages orders for multiple PCs, calculating individual and total costs based on CPU speed, hard disk capacity, and RAM size. 
The program allows users to input specifications for each PC, dynamically allocates memory to store multiple PC objects, and computes the cost of each configuration using a pricing formula. 
It then displays each PC's details and the total order cost, providing a clear breakdown for the user.
